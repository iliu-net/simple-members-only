## Description

This repo contains a fork of `Simple Members Only` plugin that used to be in the wordpress
repository but it seems to have fallen off the face of the earth since.

"Simple Members Only" is a simple way to make your whole website only viewable to members who
are logged in. You will be able to assign a page where non-members are redirected or choose
for all non-members to just be directed to the login page. Make your wordpress website a members
only website in only a few clicks!

## Installation

1. Upload `simple-members-only` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or upload simple-members-only.zip via wordpress upload button in the plugins area in the backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' area in WordPress.
3. On your backend area, go to the 'Simple Members Only' settings page, in the 'Settins Menu' and turn the 'Simple Members Only' checkbox ON and enjoy!
